How to Play
The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
Player 1 is 'X' and Player 2 is 'O'.
Players take turns marking a square.

The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) wins.

If all 9 squares are filled and no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a draw.
